However, the High Court verdict has stated that that incident was no pertinent and, it was the best example to that effect.\n\u00a0\nThey also said that judicial medical reports have also confirmed that former MP Duminda Silva received gunshots on his forehead.\n\u00a0\nHe said the High court verdict has been given not on the submissions or evidence made before the Court but it has been given merely on former MP Duminda Silva\u2019s popular political recognition.\n\u00a0\nThey said although the verdict is read one hundred thousand times, it is not possible to understand why former MP Duminda Silva has been convicted.\n\u00a0\nTherefore the president counsels proved before the Supreme Court that the High court verdict that convicted former MP Duminda Silva is not legitimate at all.\n\u00a0\nThey said the High court judge has given the verdict, without examining whether the evidence is proved beyond reasonable doubt but based on the opinions submitted by the state counsels.\n\u00a0\nThe President Counsels further pointed out before the Supreme Court that the High Court has ignored the submissions made by the Duminda Silva faction or the defence submissions and, has conducted the trial based on the fictitious incidents and evidence.\n\u00a0\nHe said that this Case was filed to tarnish the image of former MP Duminda Silva, therefore, he has been denied a justifiable trial similar to that of any other citizen is entitled to in this Case.\n\u00a0\nThe appeal will be called again tomorrow.\n"},

An official review in 2012 found that the department had destroyed thousands of documents detailing British counter-insurgency operations in Kenya and other colonies as the empire came to an end.\n\u00a0\nUnder the Public Records Act, 1958 government departments are obliged to preserve historical records. But, in response to a Freedom of Information request from the Guardian asking for information about the destruction of the files, the Foreign Office stated that it was not required to preserve the documents. It said the files\u2019 content \u201cmay be of a policy nature but might also be administrative or ephemeral\u201d.\n\u00a0\nThe Foreign Office has now confirmed that it destroyed 195 files on Sri Lanka, dating from 1978 to 1980, three decades after the country became independent from Britain. The department would not say exactly when, where, or how the destruction occurred.\n\u00a0\n\u201cFiles not selected for permanent preservation would have been destroyed offsite by the company contracted by the FCO for this purpose,\u201d it said. \u201cWe understand the files would have been destroyed in line with the FCO\u2019s paper and file destruction contract in force at the time.\u201d\n\u00a0\nRachel Seoighe, a criminologist and Sri Lanka expert, at Middlesex University, said: \u201cThis discovery is very concerning given the lack of public information available about British involvement in Sri Lankan security practices at the beginning of the civil war.\u201d She has filed a complaint with Unesco, the international body that protects world heritage.\n\u00a0\nShe added: \u201cWe know from other contexts, such as Kenya, that official files have been deliberately destroyed to conceal and deny abuse. The public has a right to know the extent to which Britain assisted Sri Lankan preparations for a war that was defined by disappearances, torture and mass atrocity.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe Foreign Office kept a list of file titles, showing that the destroyed papers would have covered a range of important subjects, from security cooperation and arms sales to foreign aid and \u201crequests for political asylum in the UK\u201d.\n\u00a0\nThe scale of destruction is such that only three files have survived from 1978, compared to 38 files from the previous year.\n\u00a0\nThe loss of these records is a blow for Tamil historians, who struggled to safeguard records throughout the Sri Lankan civil war. The famous Jaffna library was burnt down in 1981 by anti-Tamil groups, incinerating almost 100,000 documents including irreplaceable ancient texts.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThe Tamil community is making strenuous efforts to collect and preserve records on history and the human rights situation in post-independence Sri Lanka,\u201d said Vairamuttu Varadakumar, executive secretary of the, in Kingston, London. \u201cWe are horrified to learn that the UK\u2019s Foreign Office has destroyed vital information on the British government\u2019s training and arming of Sri Lankan security forces, which were involved in widespread human rights violations against the Tamils.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe Foreign Office claim that the information contained in the files was insignificant has caused dismay among Tamil experts. Varadakumar said: \u201cIt is improper for the UK government to deceive the public, who have the right to know. It appears that the Foreign Office\u2019s action is designed to cover up the involvement of the SAS and MI5 in the training of Sri Lankan security forces that might be potentially embarrassing to her majesty\u2019s government.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe Special Air Service visit to Sri Lanka is only mentioned in a handful of surviving files at the National Archives, which were preserved by the Ministry of Defence. Their contents have never been reported on before.\n\u00a0\nOne MoD file reveals that late in 1978 Sri Lanka\u2019s right-wing president, Junius Richard Jayewardene asked the Foreign Office for a British security expert to visit his country to help counter Tamil militants who were demanding an independent state of their own. However, a Foreign Office file called Sri Lanka: Security Assessment 1978, which could have shed light on the president\u2019s request, was destroyed.\n\u00a0\nFrom the surviving defence files, it emerges that an MI5 director, who held racist views, made two advisory visits to Sri Lanka in 1979, under both Jim Callaghan\u2019s Labour government and Margaret Thatcher\u2019s Conservative administration. The full facts of these visits are hard to establish because the Foreign Office destroyed a 1979 file named Sri Lanka: Defence Visits from the UK.\n\u00a0\nThe MI5 officer was John Percival Morton CMG OBE, better known as Jack Morton, a former colonial police chief in India who had spied on the independence movement there and once wrote that Indians were \u201ca sort of immature, backward and needy people whom it was the natural British function to govern and administer\u201d. He later became a director at MI5 and held various security positions inside Whitehall.\n\u00a0\nAccording to a defence file, it was on Morton\u2019s recommendation that a SAS team visited Sri Lanka in 1980 to train a new army commando unit. Among the files destroyed by the Foreign Office was one entitled UK military assistance to Sri Lanka, 1980. The SAS visit occurred weeks after Britain\u2019s premier special forces regiment staged the Iranian embassy siege. For the next four months, the SAS team secretly trained Sri Lankan army commandos, selecting 60 members to form an elite anti-terrorist force.\n\u00a0\nA Foreign and Commonwealth Office spokesperson said: \u201cThe FCO, as with all government departments, reviews all its files in line with the requirements of the Public Records Act before making a decision on permanent preservation.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThe FCO\u2019s recommendations for the preservation or destruction of records take place under the guidance and supervision of the National Archives. FCO decisions are informed by the National Archive\u2019s records collection policy and existing FCO policy.\u201d\n\u00a0\n(The Guardian)\n"},

High Court trial that former MP Duminda Silva received gunshots at first but the verdict has stated that that was immaterial.\n\u00a0\nTherefore, the President Counsel said it was a fine example to prove that the judgment has ignored that the shooting was instigated by Bharatha Lakshman faction.\n\u00a0\nHe also said that the judicial medical reports have also confirmed that Duminda Silva received gunshots in his forehead.\n\u00a0\nPresident Counsel Anil de Silva further pointed out before the Supreme Court that the High Court has ignored the submissions made by the Duminda Silva

What must this government and army do to ensure that we don\u2019t go back to the roots of the conflict that began 30 years ago? We have to find a mechanism, a commitment within the country to satisfy our own people more than the people outside. Today, we are closer to a better solution. Democracy was restored, elections were held [in 2015], good governance was brought in\u201d, he said.\n\u00a0\nThe Army Commander said, \u201cIn this context, we are right-sizing and building a capacity-based army. We have to give back to the people by right-sizing and ensuring that the war will not recur. We are engaging with the people in the north and east to identify our responsibility. The 30 years of war were brutal, many lives were lost on both sides. This is a sort of testing period for us\u201d.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOn April 13, we released 683 acres in Palaly, a critical area. It was a very bold decision as far as the Sri Lankan armed forces are concerned and we took it. We calculated the risk, nobody pressured us. Frankly, even the government or the political leadership did not know that we were going to release land there\u201d, he disclosed.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIn another four to five months, we will return more land. We have identified some private land on which armed forces are stationed. We cannot compromise on national security. For that reason, we have to have some troops in those areas, and we are shifting them to state land. I need some finances for us to resettle\u201d, Lt. Gen. Senanayake added.\n"},

The Judge has not scrutinized whether the evidence was proved beyond reasonable doubt.\nThe President Counsel pointed out before the Supreme Court that Duminda Silva was accused of using firearms but no evidence was given during the trial to prove such charges.\nHe further stated that irrelevant evidence was given with regard to other charges as well. He said that 62 contradictions and shortcomings were marked during the trial.\nThe President Counsel said that such benefits of the doubt should have been given to the Duminda Silva faction but the Judge has neglected to do so.\n\u00a0\nIn addition, the President Counsel logically proved that incidents were concocted intending to make Duminda Silva guilty.\n\u00a0\nHe pointed out that the shooting at Duminda Silva was instigated by Bharatha Lakshman faction.
